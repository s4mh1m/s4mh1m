            <h2 id="biography">Who Was Walt Disney?</h2>

            <p>Walt Disney was an American motion-picture and television producer and showman, famous as a pioneer of cartoon films and as the creator of Disneyland.
            <br>
            Walter Elias "Walt" Disney was born on December 5, 1901, in Hermosa, Illinois. He and his brother Roy co-founded Walt Disney Productions, which became one of the best-known motion-picture production companies in the world. Disney was an innovative animator and created the cartoon character Mickey Mouse. He won 22 Academy Awards during his lifetime, and was the founder of theme parks Disneyland and Walt Disney World.
            <br>
            Disney failed several times before he became a success and went through many trials. He got married and had 2 daughters which he kept out of the public eye. He began as  democrat and converted to republican later in life. Walt Disney was a heavy smoker and died from lung cancer. He donated a percentage of his money to a school called "CalArts" to build a new school. Disney put on a public persona of a man that was happy and full of life, yet behind closed doors he had a smoking problem and was very shy.

            <h2 id="contributions">What did he contribute to Society?</h2>

            <p>Walt Disney was a pioneer as an animator of cartoons and created a mouse that has lasted centuries.
            <br>
            He created an amusement park that mirrored a fantasy land for families and children. Walt Disney has had an enduring impact on family entertainment and the vacation industry.  In his works, Walt Disney used political impulses, especially in his adherence to the American past and small-town traditional values, to reflect on the major events of the 20th century.
            <br>
            A special section of the park was built to showcase Disney’s utopian vision of the future: Tomorrowland.  It has now inspired a film of the same name, featuring many of the magical gadgets and miraculous journeys Disney dreamed of. The first multiplane camera was invented by the Walt Disney Studios animator/director Ub Iwerks in 1933, using parts from an old Chevrolet car. It moves a number of pieces of artwork past the camera at different speeds, creating a three-dimensional effect.
